# VSCode/Jupyter Installation Instructions

The following instructions should work on all systems 
for which VSCode is available.  We have tested these instructions
on macOS and Windows.

* Install Microsoft [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSCode)
* Ensure that you have a **working installation of Python 3.x**. 
   By working we mean that you can invoke Python from
   the commandline with the 'python' or 'python3' command.
   If this does not work then reinstall [Python](https://www.python.org/) making sure that you allow the installation to modify 
   your 'path' environment variable.
* Ensure that you have a **working version of git**.  Same criteria
  as above. If not then
  install it from [here](https://git-scm.com/)
* Start VSCode and load the 'install.ipynb' notebook available
   in the folder where this readme resides
* Follow the instructions in the notebook
