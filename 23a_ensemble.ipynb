To show that the techniques discussed below extend to both classes of models we refer to the machine learning models as \"learners\".  In particular, we call them \"weak learners\" in the sense that we don't require them to be particularly complex.  It has been demonstrated that ensemble techniques work with extremely weak learners such as decision trees limited to a depth of one.\n",

As published in \\\"US Industrial Outlook 1993\\\" \\n(which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space \\nbusiness are currently projected to be about $4,890 M. \\n   In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had \\nshown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are \\ndriven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are \\nprojected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 \\nsatellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also \\nprojects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, \\nand while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to \\n$450 M, future sales will be \\\"adversely affected by the downward \\nrevision in Department of Defense launch plans.\\\"                           \\n   Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, \\nrevenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to \\nincrease to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from \\nbroadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products \\nand sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%). \\n\\n US COMMERCIAL SPACE REVENUES     1989  1990   1991 1992(r) 1993(e)\\n Commercial satellites             900 1,000  1,100  1,300     670\\n Satellite services                750   800  1,200  1,500   1,900\\n   Fixed                          (700) (735)(1,115)(1,275) (1,520)\\n   Mobile                          (50) ( 65)(   85)(  225) (  380)\\n Satellite ground equip            790   860  1,350  1,400   1,560\\n   Mobile equipment                (40)  (85)  (280)  (352)    ???\\n Commercial launches               150   570    380    450     450\\n Remote sensing data and services  125   155    190    215     250\\n Private microgravity research lab  --    --     --     --      60\\n                                 ===== =====  ======  =====   =====\\n   TOTAL ANNUAL REVENUES         2,715 3,385   4,220  4,815   4,890\\n        (r) = revised data for 1992   (e) = estimated data for 1993\\n   [Commentary: This is the first look at how the US commercial \\nspace industry is expected to do in 1993.  In general, not a bad \\nreport -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite \\nmanufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth \\n$100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual \\nprojection.  If we look forward over several years, this market \\nsector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very \\nsuccessful in regaining international market share in the satellite \\nbusiness. \\n   Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in \\nthe next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-\\nyear.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including \\nsuch items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) \\nappears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually \\npublishes a listing of  \\\"Space Business Indicators\\\" in mid-year, and \\nthe next revision of commercial space revenues should be released \\nthen.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if \\nthe mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the \\nnumbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. \\n   Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite \\npromising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top \\n$3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct \\nbroadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite \\nstation sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year \\nthrough the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic \\nfor near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for \\nsubstantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the \\nnext 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative \\nassumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and \\nsatellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the \\ncurrent players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite \\nmarket and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will \\nbe financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive \\nas currently projected.) \\n   It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first \\nrelease to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research \\nfacilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for \\nthe Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space \\nShuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first \\nsales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] \\n\\n2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS\\n   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta \\nlaunch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola \\nInc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to \\nlaunch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO \\ncommunications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas \\nwas awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract. \\n   The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium \\nconstellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium \\nsatellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be \\nlaunched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle \\nlaunches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be \\nlaunched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  \\nAdditional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a \\nplanned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although \\ndetails of the launch services contract were reported to be \\nnegotiation, and not yet final. \\n   The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of \\ntheir Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 \\nmillion, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 \\nlaunches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These \\nlaunches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global \\nPositioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other \\nprograms.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is \\nexpected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected \\nto request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  \\nUnder this contract the USAF can also request \\\"launch on demand\\\" \\nservices from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to \\noccur within 40 days of the request. \\n    [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should \\nprovide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program \\nthrough the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have \\na potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and \\nsustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts \\nfor international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA \\nMedium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping \\nMDC as a viable commerical launch company. \\n    However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these \\ncontracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has \\nnot yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for \\noperation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing \\nand financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these \\napprovals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  \\nBut, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. \\n   Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of \\nseveral Congressional actions which have slowed the production of \\nthe GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III \\nprogram in favor of the USAF NLS/\\\"Spacelifter\\\" program.  At this \\ntime, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future \\nfunding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts \\nis being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy \\nreviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and \\nCongress propose cancellation of all \\\"ELV upgrade\\\" programs \\n(including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed \\\"Spacelifter\\\" \\nprogram.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget \\ndeliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to \\nfind in the shrinking US Defense budget.] \\n \\n3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC \\\"GO-AHEAD\\\"\\n   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing \\nsatellite was approved in early February by the US Department of \\nCommerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to \\nWorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and \\noperate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral \\nimages of the Earth. \\n   [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture \\nby WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the \\noperating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the \\nrequest of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new \\nventure as a \\\"Star Wars\\\" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to \\nprovide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into \\ndigital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable \\ncustomers for this service include exploration geologists, \\nagricultural planners, and urban planners.  \\n   It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the \\n1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last \\nNovember, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote \\nsensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to \\nthis act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to \\nall users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures \\nwould have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices. \\n   There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote \\nsensing ventures working their way through the system at different \\nstages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite \\nsystems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing \\ndata market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, \\ngovernment-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures \\nsuch as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use \\ninnovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the \\nmargin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures \\nappearing in the next year or so.] \\n                 \\n4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ \\\"STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT\\\" \\n   Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General \\nDynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, \\ndespite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent \\nanalyst's report Morgan Stanley said \\\"We are more than ever \\nconvinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical \\n95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-\\ngenerating unit.\\\"  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate \\nmanagement, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are \\ncleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and \\n$100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of \\ncapturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market. \\n   [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has \\nhurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has \\nrestructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, \\nmany market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might \\nbe next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space \\nSystems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current \\nproblems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected \\nto be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of \\nabout $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space \\nlaunch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability \\nof their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits \\nfrom those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur \\nprogram is back on track, this division will continue to show \\nsubstantial losses. \\n   In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation \\nis not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  \\nTo do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional \\nmanagement would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  \\nIn GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management \\nteam will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with \\nthe Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would \\nindicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch \\noperations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince \\ncustomers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would \\nhave substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in \\nmarketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for \\nthis might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly \\nMcDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash \\nflow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction \\n(Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), \\nor have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the \\n$700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of \\nchange for any company.] \\n \\n5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND\\n   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is \\nprojecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early \\nFebruary, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which \\ndetailed their projection of the space transportation market for the \\nnext decade. \\n   Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant \\nposition and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 \\ninternational and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane \\nholds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14 \\ncontracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long \\nMarch vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. \\n   Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can \\ncompete are projected to come from communications satellites with \\nthe remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and \\nscientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand \\ngrowth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region. \\n   Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of \\nindividual satellite operators into regional or national groups will \\ncontinue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with \\nlarger communications payloads carrying more transponders. \\nArianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications \\nsatellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to \\nabout 3000 kg in GEO. \\n   Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain \\nstrong over the next three years, but in the second half of the \\ndecade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace \\nbases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder \\ndemand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques \\nappear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing \\nor near-term transponders. \\n   One of the significant possible changes in the market was \\nidentified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian \\nlaunch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, \\ninvestors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade \\noff between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and \\nother new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities \\nand service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. \\n   [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and \\nI reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  \\nComparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in \\nthe numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new \\ndata compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical \\ntransponders on orbit.\\n   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-\\nbased communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While \\nfiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the \\nestablished point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing \\ndemand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-\\nmultipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space \\ntransponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability \\nservice, but only from established point A to established point B. \\nTo establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable \\nbetween the points, and while there are improved network solutions, \\ninstalling a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost \\nmillions or billions of dollars.  \\n   For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground \\nnetwork structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective \\nsolution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is \\ncheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of \\nthousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite \\nnetwork.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and \\nhas kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is \\ngrowing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, \\nit becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to \\nhandle the increase in traffic. \\n   Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still \\ngrowing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But \\nsatellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current \\ngeneration satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of \\non-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from \\nlast generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch \\ndemand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite \\nlaunches over longer intervals. \\n   And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it \\nlooks like the space transportation market will be rather over-\\nsupplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual \\ncommercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites \\nper year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up \\nto about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of \\nabout 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, \\nJapan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other \\nsystems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per \\nyear.  That's a lot of capability for a small market. \\n   We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial \\nlaunches.]\\n\\n6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT \\n   The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has \\nspawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety \\nrules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt \\nthe mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation \\nof range safety rules.  \\n   In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of \\ntwo abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure \\ntypically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at \\nWallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute \\nbefore the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was \\noverridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the \\ncommunications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the \\nvalid abort call. \\n   Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort \\ncommand receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an \\ninvestigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to \\nlaunch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. \\n   Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety \\nBoard (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This \\ninvestigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an \\nincident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their \\ninvestigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at \\nlines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used \\nin the launch. \\n  [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an \\ninvestigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested \\nby the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space \\nTransportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.  \\n   At the time of writing this column, some of the initial \\ninvestigations have been concluded, and some of the results are \\nstarting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four \\ndifferent communications channels were in use during the test. After \\nthe abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test \\ndirector and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops \\nIsland gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  \\nAccording to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. \\nSomehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the \\nNASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying \\nthe Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing \\nexplainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the \\nbest set being that clear lines of communications and clear \\ndefinition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and \\nunderstanding of the mission rules were not established before the \\nlaunch.  \\n   As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these \\nprocedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   \\nThis case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has \\nbeen called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they \\ndo with commercial aircraft problems).  \\n   I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with \\nprocedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance \\nof guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how \\nspecific lines of authority should be delineated.] \\n\\n7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED\\n   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new \\nsmall space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  \\nTwo versions of the launcher are being marketed: the \\\"Aerokosmos\\\" \\nwinged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the \\\"Severkosmos\\\", \\nlaunched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is \\nprojected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to \\nan 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 \\nkg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used \\nwith these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called \\n'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military \\nestablishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of \\nspacecraft and which has participated in the development of the \\nBuran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia \\nfacility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow. \\n   [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new \\nventure.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking \\nfor hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house \\nknowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous \\ncommercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union. \\n   This one's a little different in that they are offering variants \\nof ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being \\ntargeted or substantial financial backing.]\\n\\n8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING\\n   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the \\nresults of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial \\nrocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland \\nMissile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary \\nstudy recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch \\nsite, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected \\nlow investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic \\nconsiderations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal \\nfor other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. \\n   [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the \\nKingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still \\nproceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland \\nfound without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if \\nsubstantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected \\nreturns were too low to justify the cost of development.  \\n   This might point out some key discriminators in judging the \\nfeasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:\\n  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage \\nsufficient to recover setup costs?\\n  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?\\n  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?\\n  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the \\ninvestment?  \\n   Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at \\nWoomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore \\nPlatform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against \\nthese criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying \\non hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]\\n\\n9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING\\n   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush \\nauthorized space technology transfer for several joint space \\nventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed \\nuse of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that \\nregulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch \\nvehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first \\nlaunch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as \\na small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into \\nLEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, \\nincluding 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  \\nOriginated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in \\ndevelopment funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor \\nlaunch vehicle as well as from the US. \\n   [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity \\nin providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small \\npayloads from European firms or organizations currently use either \\nAriane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  \\nHowever, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout \\nprogram is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the \\nItalian government and space industry regarding any follow-on \\nsystem).  \\n   This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch \\nsystem.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of \\nsuch a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies \\nhave been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche \\nAerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the \\nSwedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to \\nfind any other European development work with even a rumor of \\nfunding for hardware. \\n   Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the \\nArgentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting \\nrumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space \\nlauncher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled \\nthe country in the 1970's and early 1980's. \\n   What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally \\ntransferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new \\ncivilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de \\nAtividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described \\nas originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket \\nprogram in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German \\nfirms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq \\nin the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and \\ntested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package \\nlagged that of the propulsion system. \\n   It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first \\nscientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B \\nsatellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes \\ncooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has \\nyet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air \\nlaunched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this \\ncontract.] \\n\\n10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP\\n   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in \\nlate February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract \\nfrom the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2 \\nlaunch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar \\nSatellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish \\nSpace Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and \\noffering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According \\nto PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya \\nlaunch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-\\nenclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like \\nthe PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as \\\"the main \\nalternative rocket supplier\\\" for the small satellite launch service \\nto be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the \\nSwedish satellite was not specified. \\n   [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and \\nfunding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a \\nsmall, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From \\nPacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series \\nrockets are built of \\\"off the shelf\\\" components based upon the Lunar \\nMOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a \\n225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.  \\n   PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its \\nfirst three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and \\n2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired \\nTRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary \\nengineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder \\nclosely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same \\nbuilding).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, \\nlaunch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. \\nSumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the \\nboard of directors.  \\n   PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least \\n$550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been \\nsearching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to \\ndesign, build and launch their first set of vehicles. \\n   The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help \\nbring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need \\nmuch more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real \\nhardware.] \\n\\n11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED\\n    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications \\nventure between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  \\nAs reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), \\nheadquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist \\nParty, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China \\nGreat Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional \\ncommunications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite \\nsystem cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the \\nsatellite's communications channels.  \\n   [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the \\nrelease of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid \\nJanuary).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of \\nTaiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg \\nscientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional \\nsatellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has \\nbeen helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 \\nM) through 2006.  \\n   I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this \\nventure and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  \\nWhile Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the \\ncurrent Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two \\nseparate sastellite ventures. \\n   The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is \\\"Asiasat-\\n2\\\", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing \\nHong Kong-based \\\"Asiasat\\\" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and \\nother Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational \\nmodel.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing \\nventure -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to \\nTaiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later \\nsatellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between \\nTaiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture \\nthrough a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to \\nproceed. \\n   In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with \\nsubstantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This \\nis just another indicator to add to the list.] \\n\\n12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES\\n   South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently \\nannounced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and \\nanother US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for \\nadvanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been \\nspecifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with \\nmanufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by \\n1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's \\naerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by \\n2000.                                 \\n   [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its \\nnational aerospace industry, specifically including space \\nactivities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are \\ncoming into the commercial space market. \\n   As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications \\nsatellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 \\non Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide \\ntelevision and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, \\nsouthwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea. \\n   South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on \\nAriane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US \\n$8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of \\nthis year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely \\\"made in Korea.\\\"  \\nUribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-\\nmonitoring micro-satellite. \\n   This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth \\nobservation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) \\nproject, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean \\ngovernment, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with \\noptical and microwave sensors.\\n   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel \\nmilitary effort to establish the capabilities for building and \\nlaunching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a \\ngovernment panel had been established to oversee such an effort, \\nfunded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  \\nexpected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the \\nKorean peninsula.       \\n   In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean \\nis also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing \\naerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is \\noffsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as \\npart of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of \\nconsumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports \\nsatellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has \\nannounced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).  \\n   This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  \\nConsidering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector \\nfor commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a \\nSouth Korean push into space technologies may change the composition \\nof commercial space market there over the next decade.] \\n\\n13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH\\n   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the \\nresults of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and \\ninvestments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of \\nMarch.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the \\nmarket as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% \\nof the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a \\ngeneral increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The \\nincrease in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which \\nis a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this \\ntrend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite \\nwell, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms \\nwhich are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its \\nresults in all of 1993.

As I said at the start \\nof this, column there's been a lot of interesting happenings - but \\nI'll have to put them into the next issue.  \\n   Looking ahead, I've got several articles in the works on new \\nhappenings with Iridium and the LEO communications satellite market, \\nmore news on international launchers appearing (and disappearing) on \\nthe market, new international commercial space ventures,  and other \\ninteresting developments. \\n   And as always, I hope you folks find this stuff useful and \\ninteresting -- Any and all comments are welcome. \\n\",\n          \"\\nI gues it is Keesler. The others do not ring the bell but they might be \\ninvolved as well.
