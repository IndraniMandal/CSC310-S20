join](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_(SQL)) combines columns from one or more tables in a relational database.  A JOIN is a means for combining columns from one (self-join) or more tables by using values common to each.  The most common and default join is the `INNER JOIN` which returns the rows from each table for which the join condition is true.\n","\n","![alt](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/img_innerjoin.gif)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kTahVlUXff5W"},"source":["This is where the foreign keys come in handy -- recall that foreign keys are like pointers from one table to another,\n","\n","<img src=\"https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781788390415/graphics/cac1f609-1c45-46d7-b066-d9481ceddf18.png\">\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-ApPMMR7ff5W"},"source":["Let's try a join on our 'world' database: We want to print out the top 10 city names, country names, and population."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"id":"rYARlaZFff5X","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1617975273182,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":3323,"user":{"displayName":"Lutz Hamel","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhGw3Lpyn8v_49EbZpajVWtDhieE3O3Dn1YoG2yfQ=s64","userId":"10287662568849688016"}}},"source":["# print out the top 10 city names, country names, and population.\n","import pymysql as sql\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","# Open database connection to our test database\n","db = sql.connect(host=host, \n","                 user=user, \n","                 password=password, \n","                 database=userdb)\n","\n","# get data using a pandas dataframe\n","sql_string = \\\n","'''\n","SELECT \n","    city.name as City, \n","    country.name as Country,\n","    city.population as Population\n","FROM \n","    city \n","JOIN \n","    country \n","ON \n","    city.countrycode = country.code \n","ORDER\n","    by city.population DESC\n","LIMIT\n","    10\n","'''\n","\n","data = pd.read_sql(sql_string, con=db) \n","print (data)\n","\n","# disconnect from server\n","db.close()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dIc4gq9Aff5X"},"source":["Let's try another one: let's query each city with its population and its country's population."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"id":"4iSmpD5iff5X","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1617975273183,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":3317,"user":{"displayName":"Lutz Hamel","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhGw3Lpyn8v_49EbZpajVWtDhieE3O3Dn1YoG2yfQ=s64","userId":"10287662568849688016"}}},"source":["# let's query each city with its population and its country's population.\n","import pymysql as sql\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","# Open database connection to our test database\n","db = sql.connect(host=host, \n","                 user=user, \n","                 password=password, \n","                 database=userdb)\n","\n","# get data using a pandas dataframe\n","sql_string = \\\n","'''\n","SELECT \n","    country.name as Country,\n","    city.name as City,\n","    city.population as CityPop,\n","    country.population as CountryPop,\n","    city.population / country.population as Factor\n","FROM \n","    city \n","JOIN \n","    country \n","ON \n","    city.countrycode = country.code \n","ORDER\n","    by Factor DESC\n","LIMIT\n","    10\n","'''\n","\n","data = pd.read_sql(sql_string, con=db) \n","print (data)\n","\n","# disconnect from server\n","db.close()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"eDJZG0sJff5Y"},"source":["One more!
