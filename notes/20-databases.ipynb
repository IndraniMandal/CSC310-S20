    "* A table is simply a collection of rows and columns, very similar to Pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "* A database typically contains multiple tables.\n",
    "* Each table typically has at least one column called the **primary or foreign key**. \n",
    "* These special columns allow the user to pose queries across multiple different tables at the same time - to perform a **join** across tables.\n",
    "* A primary key is a column that holds a **unique** value for each row in the table.  This is used by the db engine to optimize queries against the table.\n",
    "* A foreign key is a column where each value point to the primary key of another table.  So you can think of a foreign key as pointer from one table to another.\n",
    "* Tables together with primary/foreign key relationships are called the **schema of a database**.\n",
    "* SQL is used to query the data in a relational database.  \n",
    "* Data returned from an SQL query is returned as a table.\n",
